# Movement Controller

I developed an extensive C# player controller for a game I'm currently working on. These scripts encompass various functionalities, enabling the player to perform actions like walking, running, jumping, crouching, shooting, and teleporting. Additionally, they also incorporate nuanced enhancements in player movement, such as simulated breathing, subtle head movements, and landing animations. In this game, players can shoot a ball and effortlessly teleport to its location by simply pressing a button.
